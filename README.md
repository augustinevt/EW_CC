Hello Eurowing Digital team!

Here is my official submission. This was honestly a pleasure to work on!

If you have any questions, feedback, or something is not working as expected, please reach out to me.

Thanks again,

â€“ August

A few notes:

  1. A imgur `client_id` is required to make allow the ExpressJS proxy-server to make authorized calls. I would be happy to share mine with you, but due force of habit I did not include them on Github.

  2. If time allowed, I would probably have set up some tests with cypress and jest at critical points of the app functionality

## How to get started

```
$ git clone
```

```
$ yarn install
```

```
$ yarn run serve-proxy
```

```
$ yarn serve
```
